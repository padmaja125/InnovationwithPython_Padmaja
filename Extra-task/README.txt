EXTRA TASK
DATA STRUCTURES
1. Create a list of given structure and get the Access list as provided below:
x=[100,200,300,400,500,[1,2,3,4,5,[10,20,30,40,50],6,7,8,9],600,700,800]
Access list: [1, 2, 3, 4]Access list: [600, 700]
Access list: [100, 300, 500, 600, 800]
Access list: [[800, 700, 600, [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, [10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 6, 7, 8, 9], 500, 400, 300, 200, 100]]
Access list: [10]
Access list: [ ]
2. Create a list of thousand numbers using range and xrange and see the difference between each
other.
(For reference:https://www.techbeamers.com/python-xrange-range/)
3. How Tuple is beneficial as compared to the list?
4. Write a program in Python to iterate through the list of numbers in the range of 1,100 and print
the number which is divisible by 3 and is a multiple of 2.
5. Write a program in Python to reverse a string and print only the vowel alphabet if it exists in the
string with their index.
6. Write a program in Python to iterate through the string “hello my name is abcde” and print the
string which is having an even length.
Create two lists such as even_list and odd_list
Ask user to enter a number in the range of 1,50 and make sure if the entered number is
even, append it to the even_list and if the entered number is odd append it to the odd_list.
Keep that in mind you can only add 5 items in each list
Make sure once you enter all the 5 elements, calculate the sum of the list and return the
maximum of the list.
7. Write a program in python to print the pair of numbers whose sum is equal to the result
number that is let's say 8.
x=[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,-1]
8. Write a program in Python to complete the following task:
9. Write a program to find out the occurrence of a specific character from an alphanumeric string.
Sample input: 12abcbacbaba344ab
Expected output: a=5 b=5 c=2
NOTE: Make sure to avoid counting the occurrence of numeric values in the string.
10. Generate and print another tuple whose values are even numbers in the given tuple
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10).
