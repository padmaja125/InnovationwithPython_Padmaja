1. Create a list of 10 elements of four different data types like int, string, complex and float.
2. Create a list of size 5 and execute the slicing structure
3. Write a program to get the sum and multiply of all the items in a given list.
4. Find the largest and smallest number from a given list.
5. Create a new list which contains the specified numbers after removing the even numbers from a
predefined list.
6. Create a list of elements such that it contains the squares of the first and last 5 elements between
1 and30 (both included).
7. Write a program to replace the last element in a list with another list.
Sample input: [1,3,5,7,9,10], [2,4,6,8]
Expected output: [1,3,5,7,9,2,4,6,8]
8. Create a new dictionary by concatenating the following two dictionaries:
Sample input: a={1:10,2:20} b={3:30,4:40}
Expected output: {1:10,2:20,3:30,4:40}
9. Create a dictionary that contain numbers in the form(x:x*x) where x takes all the values between 1
and n(both 1 and n included).
Sample input: n=5
Expected output: {1:1, 2:4, 3:9, 4:16, 5:25}
10. Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma-separated numbers from console and
generates a list and a tuple which contains every number in the form of string.
Sample input: 34,67,55,33,12,98
Expected output: [‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’] (‘34’,’67’,’55’,’33’,’12’,’98’)
