1. Write a program that calculates and prints the value according to the given formula:
Q= Square root of [(2*C*D)/H]
Following are the fixed values of C and H:
C is 50.
H is 30.
D is a variable whose values should be input to your program in a comma-separated sequence.
2. Define a class named Shape and its subclass Square. The Square class has an init function which
takes length as argument. Both classes have an area function which can print the area of the shape
where Shapeâ€™s area is 0 by default.
3. Create a class to find three elements that sum to zero from a set of n real numbers
Input array: [-25,-10,-7,-3,2,4,8,10]
Expected output: [[-10,2,8],[-7,-3,10]]
4. Create a Time class and initialize it with hours and minutes.
Create a method addTime which should take two Time objects and add them.
E.g.- (2 hour and 50 min)+(1 hr and 20 min) is (4 hr and 10 min)
Create another method displayTime which should print the time.
Also create a method displayMinute which should display the total minutes in the Time.
E.g.- (1 hr 2 min) should display 62 minute.
